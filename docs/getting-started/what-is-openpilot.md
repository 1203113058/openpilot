# What is openpilot?

openpilot is an open source driver assistance system that offers adaptive cruise control (ACC), automatic lane centering (ALC), forward collision warning (FCW), and lane departure warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](../CARS.md). openpilot performs similarly to Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise, but it's [free, open source software](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/) that runs on a dedicated hardware module, the [comma 3/3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-three).

## What openpilot does

openpilot uses the camera, radar, and other sensors already present in your car to:

- Automatically keep your car centered in the lane
- Automatically maintain a safe distance from the car ahead of you
- Automatically change lanes when you turn on the blinker (on select cars)
- Automatically slow down for curves
- Automatically slow down for exits
- Automatically slow down for traffic lights and stop signs (beta)
- Automatically resume from a stop

## What you need to do

openpilot is not a self-driving system. It's a driver assistance system that requires you to pay attention at all times. You are still responsible for your car, and you must keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

## What you need to get started

- A [supported car](../CARS.md)
- A [comma 3/3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-three)
